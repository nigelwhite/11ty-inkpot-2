Component build docs
- Nunjucks Macros is used to allow components to be given parameters in each child instance
- [Pattern](https://www.trysmudford.com/blog/encapsulated-11ty-components/)
- src/_includes/components/button_action/button_action.njk contains html and param slots
- src/_includes/system/component.njk is a global component macro. This allows simpler code to instantiate each instance.
- any page which needs to call component.njk must have a reference to it at the start of the page - {%- from "./_includes/system/component.njk" import component -%}
